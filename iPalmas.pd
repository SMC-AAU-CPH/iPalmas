#X text 89 61 When the user starts the tutoring session \, red circle
/visual tutor responds repetitively based on the defined tempo based
and the chosen style. Visual tutor highlights the accentuated beats
by scaling up the radius size and the thickness of the red circle.
Whenever there is non-accentuated beat in the pattern \, the radius
and the thickness of the circle are scaled down to the original dimensions.

#X text 91 175 Visual feedback synthesis module listes to the clapping
input of the user and visualize the tempo and patern input with the
gray color circle. Similar to the visual tutor responses \, the accentuated
beats are highlighted with resizing the radius and the tichness of
the circle \, and they are scaled down to the original dimensions when
the module recognize non-accentuated beats in the pattern. Visual transcription
of the tutorial pattern is also displayed below the cirlces on the
screen. The symbol x represents the accentuated beat and the symbol
- represents non-accentuated beat.;
#X text 89 332 When the user begins to match the clapping pattern and
the tempo \, the gray circle moves towards the red circle in order
to give matching -closer feedback to the user. The moment that the
visual feedback synthesis module recognizes the possible exact match
\, then the gray circle locates itself on top of the red circle and
both of them responds within the pattern. If the user chnages the tempo
then the gray cicle moves apart from the red one.;
